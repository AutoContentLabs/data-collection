## Overview of Directories

- **`src/`**: This is the main directory containing the application's source code.
  - **`adapters/`**: Contains different adapters for various data sources, such as APIs, files, or databases.
  - **`collectors/`**: Houses the components that use the adapters to gather data.
  - **`config/`**: Contains configuration files for the application.
  - **`migrations/`**: Includes migration files for updating the database schema.
  - **`models/`**: Contains data models, which represent the data structure used in the application.
  - **`processors/`**: Contains components responsible for processing the data collected.
  - **`seeds/`**: Includes files that contain initial data to seed the database.
  - **`utils/`**: Contains utility functions and general-purpose tools.
